#### Wireframes

Before diving into development, our project harnessed wireframing techniques to meticulously structure the platform's user interface. These wireframes formed the bedrock of our design, mapping out the strategic placement of essential elements and interactions. This early visualization of the layout played a crucial role in refining the user experience, guaranteeing intuitive navigation and seamless interaction for our users. This systematic approach not only guided our development efforts but also paved the way for crafting a polished, user-centric platform interface.

#### Mobile

During UI design, our focus on mobile convenience didn't compromise the desktop experience. We implemented a responsive design approach that seamlessly accommodates both mobile and desktop users. The relocation of the navigation bar to the bottom for mobile usage didn't hinder the functionality or accessibility on desktop. This approach ensured that users, regardless of their device, could navigate the site with ease, offering a consistent and intuitive experience across various platforms.
