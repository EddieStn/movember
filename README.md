## Design

### The Strategy Plane

#### Project Theme

This project is being created for the “Talking Tech: Men’s Health Reimagined” Movember Hackathon and will focus on Men’s **mental health**.


#### Research into Men's Mental Health

There is clear and well evidenced research showing:

-	Men’s mental health is a very real and current issue.

-	Men are at higher risk of suicide that women, in particular men aged 40-49.

-	There are clear links between loneliness and poorer physical health.

-	There are clear associations between loneliness and poorer mental health.

-	Loneliness is an area where more needs to be done.

However, there is little current research around how loneliness is most effectively tackled. With the suggestion that a 
> range of approaches may be required, tailored to fit people’s individual experiences of loneliness and contexts.

Detailed account of research
</summary>

[Mental Health Foundation](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/men-and-mental-health)

The above website provided key insight into men’s mental health with our takeaways from the information being:
-	Men’s mental health is a very real and current issue. 
-	Three times as many men as women die by suicide.
-	Men aged 40 to 49 have the highest suicide rates in the UK.
-	Men are less likely to access psychological therapies than women.
-	A range of underlying factors make it harder for men to reach out for help and open up.
-	Men may also be more likely to use potentially harmful coping methods (example: drugs, alcohol, escapism) and less likely to talk to family or friends about their mental health.
-	Positively research suggest men will get the help that meets their preferences and is easy, meaningful and engaging.

[Suicide risk factors for middle aged men](https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/middle-aged-men-suicide/suicide-risk-factors-middle-aged-men/)

The above document provided further insight into the research around why Men aged 40 to 49 have the highest suicide rates. Key takeaways:
-	In terms of age, gender and socio-economic status, the group most at risk of suicide are middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds.
-	Factors that play a role in suicide risk include: personality traits, masculinity, challenges of mid-life, relationship breakdown, emotional illiteracy and socio-economic factors.
-	Suicide prevention policy and practice must take account of men’s beliefs, concerns and context.
-	Recognition that for men in mid-life, **loneliness is a very significant cause of their high risk of suicide**, and (prevention policy and practice must) **enable men to strengthen their social relationships**.

[Tackling loneliness evidence review: main report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-loneliness-evidence-review/tackling-loneliness-evidence-review-full-report#what-we-know-and-what-we-do-not-know-about-loneliness)

The above document (updated March 2023), which is mainly geared towards building the evidence around loneliness summarised what the **current research** shows. Key quotes from the document:
‘Indeed, there is now **exhaustive work linking loneliness to poorer physical health** during adulthood.’
‘There is now cross-sectional evidence to support the **association between loneliness and a range of psychiatric disorders**, including anxiety, depression, and psychosis, and to support an **association between loneliness and suicidal thoughts and behaviour**.’
‘Evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis shows **loneliness is a significant predictor of both suicidal ideation and behaviour, with depression potentially the link between loneliness and suicidal ideation/behaviour** (McLelland et al., 2020)’.

The document also went into current research about the effectiveness and acceptability of interventions to address loneliness and mental health problems:
‘Available evidence about the determinants of loneliness in people with mental health problems suggest a **range of approaches may be required, tailored to fit people’s individual experiences of loneliness and contexts. For some, loneliness is strongly linked to social isolation and lack of supportive social contact; for others; psychological factors including perceived social threat and sense of belongingness are important drivers of loneliness.** Different intervention options to meet these needs are desirable.’
However:
“In most cases what we have are preliminary studies that show approaches are feasible and acceptable, but do not provide definitive evidence.”

#### Project Focus

Our team has chosen to focus on the need for innovation in how we can tackle loneliness, designing a solution tailored towards men and taking into account their preferences and the barriers they may face.

It is to be noted that there are two sides to loneliness:

-	social isolation and lack of supportive social contact

-	psychological factors including perceived social threat and sense of belongingness

Our solution will initial be focused on providing an innovation solution to tackling social isolation and lack of supportive social contact. Once the platform is in use and has been scaled up, the next area of growth will focus on how the platform can be used to tackle the psychological factors associated with isolation.

#### Target User Group

Men with a special focus towards men aged 40-49. 

Note, while this is the target user group it is important that the project created remains open to all.


#### Problem Statement

“I am a man aged 40 – 49 experiencing loneliness due to social isolation and a lack of supportive social contact. I feel shy, anxious about connecting with others and embarrassed to reach out and ask for help. My loneliness is a contributing factor in my decreasing physical and mental health and is also increasing my risk factor for suicide.”

#### Project Aim

To create a plaform where men can come together and connect with others over shared interests. They will be able to create and comment on blog posts and sign up to online and in-person events. 

Uniquely, the platform will be designed to provide as few as possible barriers for men initially joining the platform (no expectations and the option to remain anonymous). As they grow more comfortable and at ease on the platform they can choose to start contributing and become more visible. When ready, they can then take the next steps into asking questions about events and then signing up and going along. 

#### Mission Statement

“When the leap is too great, step by step the impossible becomes achievable. Supporting men across the chasm from loneliness to connection, friendship and belonging, through shared interests.”

The flow chart below plans how users might negotiate that chasm step by step through our site.

### The Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframes

Before diving into development, our project harnessed wireframing techniques to meticulously structure the platform's user interface. These wireframes formed the bedrock of our design, mapping out the strategic placement of essential elements and interactions. This early visualization of the layout played a crucial role in refining the user experience, guaranteeing intuitive navigation and seamless interaction for our users. This systematic approach not only guided our development efforts but also paved the way for crafting a polished, user-centric platform interface.

#### Mobile

During UI design, our focus on mobile convenience didn't compromise the desktop experience. We implemented a responsive design approach that seamlessly accommodates both mobile and desktop users. The relocation of the navigation bar to the bottom for mobile usage didn't hinder the functionality or accessibility on desktop. This approach ensured that users, regardless of their device, could navigate the site with ease, offering a consistent and intuitive experience across various platforms.

### The Surface Plane

#### Typography

##### Headings: Kanit

We've chosen Kanit for our headings to infuse a sense of modernity and elegance into our platform. Kanit's clean and stylish appearance adds visual interest to headers, making them stand out while maintaining readability and professionalism.

##### Body Text: Roboto

For the body text, we've opted for Roboto for its excellent readability across various screen sizes. Roboto's clean and versatile style ensures a comfortable reading experience for users, enhancing content legibility and clarity throughout the platform.


Our choice of Kanit for headings and Roboto for body text from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) aims to establish a consistent and unified typographic style. This deliberate selection ensures a seamless visual flow, guiding users through content effortlessly while presenting a cohesive and refined interface.

#### Color Scheme

Our platform is designed as a vibrant and welcoming space, dedicated to fostering connections and combatting loneliness through shared interests. The choice of colours plays a pivotal role in crafting this user experience. The background, adorned with #f5f5f5, sets the backdrop, ensuring content clarity. Headers and footers feature #93B8BF, imbuing a sense of coherence and continuity throughout the platform. To prompt actions and engagements, #FFAE42 energizes the calls to action, inviting users to participate actively in the community. The hero text container, highlighted in #e6e1c5 against hero images, evokes warmth and readability, drawing attention to key messages. Within cards showcasing blogs and events, #667a92 infuses a touch of elegance to titles, adding visual interest and aiding in content categorization. Finally, #000 delivers crisp and legible text, ensuring readability across all interactions, fostering a seamless and engaging experience.

[Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) played a crucial role in our colour selection process. We used its tools to explore different combinations, aiming for colours that feel inviting, coherent, and engaging. After trying various options, we settled on a palette that reflects our commitment to fostering connections and combating loneliness. These colours blend well, offering a balance between calming backgrounds and vibrant elements like call-to-action prompts, ensuring readability and visual appeal throughout the platform. Colormind.io was instrumental in helping us create a cohesive and inviting visual identity that aligns with our platform's mission.

<img src="documentation/readme-images/colormind-screenshot.png">

Ensuring accessibility and readability for all users is paramount. We utilized [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to evaluate and fine-tune our colour choices. By assessing the contrast ratios, we confirmed that our selected palette meets accessibility standards, guaranteeing clear legibility and visual clarity across our platform. This tool enabled us to verify that our colour combinations maintain adequate contrast, supporting inclusivity and a seamless user experience for everyone.
